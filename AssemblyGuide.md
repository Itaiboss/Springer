# Assembly Instructions

## PCB
###### Soldering:
Ensure all components have correct polarity and fit into the board. Reference soldering notes for tips with specific components.
###### Mounting :
Print two chassis rings and insert the PCB through the ring and screw the PCB down into the chassis.
## Head
###### 3D printing:
Using ABS filament, use the files on github to create gcode files that give instructions to the printer. This process is called slicing, there are many free online slicers to use for this process, as well as hosting the printer (controlling it). Standard ABS settings should work well for most printers, but for better quality changing height layers, amount and temperature can all give varying results. Ensure supports are on for all of the print files.
###### Silicone:
Mix parts A and B 1:1 by **weight** in a plastic cup. Mix for at least 3 minutes making sure to scrape the sides and bottom. Prepare the head key by taping over the areas where the LEDâ€™s and photodiodes are to ensure a smooth flat surface. Resin tape works well for this step. Use two sided tape to stick the head key print to the bottom of another cup. Pour epoxy over the key ~1 inch above the highest piece of plastic slowly. To allow any bubbles that may have formed to escape, seal the cup with saran wrap and put it in the fridge for 1 hour to slow the curing process and allow bubbles to escape. After, allow mold to cure in a dry room at room temperature. Let cure for at least 8 hours. Trim the top of the epoxy until you can remove the print. Using a small knife cut excess silicone until the head fits all the way in, be careful not to cut below the layer with the photodiode hole.
###### Epoxy:
Insert the head print into the silicone mold created by the key print in the above process. Mix parts A and B 1:1 by **volume** thoroughly for at least 3 minutes in a plastic cup making sure to scrape the bottom and sides. Pour epoxy slowly and in small amounts and wait some time between pouring to allow bubbles to escape and try to keep the wires elevated so they do not get stuck in the epoxy. Use a lighter or torch on the top surface of the epoxy to level the epoxy and remove bubbles be careful not to burn the wires. Let cure for 24 hours.
## Housing
###### Pipe:
 Cut pvc to desired size using a pvc cutter or hacksaw. 6" minimum. Try to keep a straight clean cut. 	
###### Head:
Add a bit of waterproof grease to the O rings and slip them into their grooves. Connect wires from the head to the pcb and slide the mounted PCB into the tube. Lastly push the head down into the tube, if the head has issues sliding in, try twisting the head slightly.
###### End Cap:
Insert the Wetlink Penetrator into the slot, slide the cable through the assembly and seal it according to blue robotics instructions. Allow slack in the cable and then connect to the ports on the PCB. Add a bit of waterproof grease to the O rings and slip them into their grooves. Push head into the tube.
